# Getting started

The saker.clang package runs as part of the saker.build system. The packages are distributed using the saker.nest repository. In order to install them, see the installation guides for [saker.build](root:/saker.build/doc/installation.html) and [saker.nest](root:/saker.nest/doc/installation.html).

You also need to have clang available in your build environment. This usually entails that you need clang to be installed on your build machine.

You can use the saker.clang package by referencing the contained tasks in it.
