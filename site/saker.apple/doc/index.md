# Overview

The [saker.apple](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.apple) package in the [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html) provides features for development with Apple platforms using the [saker.build system](root:/saker.build/index.html).

It contains functionality for configuring and creating applications that target one of the Apple platforms. It contains build tasks that are specific for the Apple ecosystem.

It's not a goal of the package to provide build tasks for compiling your code that have general usage outside the Apple ecosystem. The package allows you to configure the compilation tasks appropriately for targetting Apple platforms. E.g. for C++ compilation with clang, use the [saker.clang](root:/saker.clang/doc/index.html) package.
