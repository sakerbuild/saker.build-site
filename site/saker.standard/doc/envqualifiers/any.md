# Any environment

The *any* environment qualifier retrieved using the [`std.env.qualifier.any()`](/taskdoc/std.env.qualifier.any.html) task signals that the associated operation can be executed on any of the build environments.

The qualifier doesn't place any restriction on the nature of the build environment.
