# Overview

The package provides build tasks that allow querying and modifying the file system. The tasks can be used by referencing them in your build scripts. See the following documents and the task documentations for more information. 

The package also provides a common programmatic API that helps representing file references between different bundle implementations. In order to use them, develop a bundle that depends on the `saker.standard-api` bundle. You can also depend on a specific version of the main bundle if you want to take them as a task input parameter.
