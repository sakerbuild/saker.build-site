# Overview

The [saker.standard](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.standard) package in the [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html) provides common features for using the [saker.build system](root:/saker.build/index.html).

The package contains tasks which are usually commonly used by build script authors, and contains Java classes that can be used by task and bundle authors to access common functionality. It contains classes that can be used as a common communication interface between different unrelated bundles.
