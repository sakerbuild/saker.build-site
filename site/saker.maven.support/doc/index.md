# Overview

The [saker.maven.support](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.maven.support) package in the [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html) provides features for working with [Maven repositories](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html) using the [saker.build system](root:/saker.build/index.html).

Tasks in the package allow you resolve the dependencies of, localize, and download Maven artifacts. The tasks allow configuring how the system should interact with the repositories and lets you use the artifacts of theirs.

The [saker.maven.classpath](root:/saker.maven.classpath/index.html) package also allows you to create classpath out of the artifacts and support automatic downloading of the source and documentation artifacts as well.

The package doesn't support invoking Maven builds and related features, only dealing with repositories and artifacts.
