# Getting started

The saker.maven.support package runs as part of the saker.build system. The packages are distributed using the saker.nest repository. In order to install them, see the installation guides for [saker.build](root:/saker.build/doc/installation.html) and [saker.nest](root:/saker.nest/doc/installation.html). 

You don't need anything else to set up, you can use the saker.maven.support package by referencing the contained tasks in it.
