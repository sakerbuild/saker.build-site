# Getting started

The saker.compiler.utils package runs as part of the saker.build system. The packages are distributed using the saker.nest repository. In order to install them, see the installation guides for [saker.build](root:/saker.build/doc/installation.html) and [saker.nest](root:/saker.nest/doc/installation.html).

The package currently contains no build tasks. Other packages may depend on it to utilize its features. Add the `-api` bundle as an unbounded dependency to your saker.nest package implementation.
