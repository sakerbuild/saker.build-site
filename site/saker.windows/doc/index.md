# Overview

The [saker.windows](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.windows) package in the [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html) provides features for development with Windows platforms using the  [saker.build system](root:/saker.build/index.html).

It allows you to configure your builds with the appropriate SDKs, and access the features of the SDKs for Windows. The build tasks help you create the application bundles which you can distribute for your users.

It's not a goal of the package to provide build tasks for compiling your code for the Windows platform, only to properly configure them. E.g. for C++ compilation with the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler use the [saker.msvc](root:/saker.msvc/doc/index.html) package.
