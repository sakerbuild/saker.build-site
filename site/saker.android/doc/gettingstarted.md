# Getting started

The saker.android package runs as part of the saker.build system. The packages are distributed using the saker.nest repository. In order to install them, see the installation guides for [saker.build](root:/saker.build/doc/installation.html) and [saker.nest](root:/saker.nest/doc/installation.html). 

You don't need anything else to set up, you can use the saker.android package by referencing the contained tasks in it.

In order to be able to build for Android, you will also need the Android SDK. The absolute minimum is the [command line tools for Android](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools). You are recommended to update the tools that you download. You don't need Android Studio to be able to build for Android.
