# Overview

The [saker.msvc](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.msvc) package in the [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html) provides features for working with the [Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/c-cpp-building-reference?view=vs-2019) in the [saker.build system](root:/saker.build/index.html).
