# Introduction

The following articles are aimed at helping developers getting to know and understanding the saker.build tool. It will walk you through the basics, features, and usage of the build system in general.

This guide is for users of the build system for building their own project, and is not about creating [extensions and plugins](/doc/extending/index.md) for saker.build.

In any of the following examples, the build tasks may be fictional and used for exemplery purposes. They may not correspond to an actual task implementation that works the same way. The examples are for educational purposes, and readers should look for an actual implementation of a build task based on their needs. (See also: [saker.nest repository](root:/saker.nest/index.html))

Any command line argument examples will be displayed without the preceeding `java -jar saker.jar` arguments.
