# Ternary

The ternary operator is an expression that takes 3 operands and returns different values based on a conditions. Its working is similar to common programming languages, and it basically functionals like a miniature if-else statement that returns a value. It's a mixture of a control statement and expression.

```sakerscript
# evaluates to 123 if $condition is true, 456 if false
$var = $condition ? 123 : 456
```

The condition expression is evaluated the same way as the [if-else statement](/doc/scripting/langref/ifelse/index.md) does.
