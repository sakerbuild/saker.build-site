# Overview

The following articles provide explanation, recommendations, and guidelines for developing various extensions that work with the saker.build system. Developers are recommended to follow these guidelines to provide the most comprehensive and performant implementation of extensions.

It is recommended that before you get into extending saker.build, read the user guide and any other necessary resources to get an overall view about how the build system works.

When developing extensions, please refer to the [API Javadoc](/javadoc/index.html) as well instead of just relying on this guide.
