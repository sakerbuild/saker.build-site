# Overview

The following documents contain examples and use-case scenarios using the [saker.jar](https://nest.saker.build/package/saker.jar) package. The examples are related only to the features of the package, and other examples that are out of the scope of Java archive creation are not included here.

The examples focus on the additional functionality that [`saker.jar.create()`](/taskdoc/saker.jar.create.html) provides over the [`saker.zip.create()`](root:/saker.zip/taskdoc/saker.zip.create.html) task. Examples that has the same usage example as the ZIP creation task are not included here. You can view ZIP creation examples [here](root:/saker.zip/doc/examples/index.html).
